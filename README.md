Industry Lab 18: Refactoring
==========
## Before you start
You may want to check out some online resources for refactoring using your IDE. Check Canvas / Moodle for some links to get you started.

## Exercise One: Improving an Excel Data Generator
In this exercise, we have been given a program which generates random marks for a randomly generated list of students. This program reads two text files, **FirstNames.txt** and **Surnames.txt**, and creates a text file, **Data_out.txt**. You may find the source code in the `ex01` package.

In this exercise, you are required to improve this program without changing its behaviour. Here are some questions for you to think about before refactoring:
1.	What does the program do?
2.	What tests to I need to create to ensure that the program behaviour is still the same after refactoring?
3.	Is there any duplicated code?
4.	Are there any long methods?
5.	Are the variable names meaningful?
6.	What are the refactoring functions from my IDE that I can use to ease my refactoring job?

Make a note of what you’ve done to accomplish this exercise. In particular, note:
- how you have refactored the program
- what unit tests you have created, and 
- the IDE functions you’ve used which have proved useful to you.


## The FINAL Exercise: Refactoring… some code?
In the `ex02` package, there’s a program that does… something. For your **FINAL JAVA EXERCISE OF THE COURSE!!!!**, you’ll be playing round with the code and answering similar questions about it as in exercise one above, while refactoring it.

In this exercise, think in particular about how you can break the single massive class file given to you into two or more separate classes.
